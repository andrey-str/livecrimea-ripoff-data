livecrimea-ripoff-data
======================

Script for backing up publicly available articles from livecrimea.com. 

**ripoff.py** — downloads text and all images from desired user

**makemd.py** — can format downloaded articles with Markdow and removes all meaningles crap out of the file body.

Happy backuping, folks. Though I'm pretty sure I'm the only one user of this, ever :-)
